Event Weighting
===============
The `EventWeight` package calculates a set of weights attached to art events,
including the BNB flux (an implementation based on the MiniBooNE flux model),
GENIE interaction model systematics (using GENIE ReWeight via nutools), and
additional systematic uncertainties (e.g. cross section ratio uncertainties
due to second-class currents).

This package references the BNB flux reweighting code in uboonecode, and GENIE
reweighting in larsim (LArSoft).
