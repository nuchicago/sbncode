SBN Code
========
This package contains code for SBN-wide simulation and analysis. This includes:

* `fcl`: Production FHiCL configurations
* `sbncode`: Common LArSoft modules and other utilities
* `sbnanalysis`: A unified SBN analysis framework, for event selections and
  fits
* `env`: Scripts to set up joint SBND/MicroBooNE/ICARUS environments (to be
  automated in future versions)

Note that the `sbnanalysis` subpackage is built separately; see the included
README for more information.
