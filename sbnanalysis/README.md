SBN Analysis
============
This package provides a lightweight event analysis and fitting framework for
measurements within the the Short-Baseline Neutrino program at Fermilab.

It is built on [gallery](http://art.fnal.gov/gallery/), a library designed
for reading [art](http://art.fnal.gov) ROOT files.

Analysis code is stored in subdirectories of `ana`, with one directory per
analysis. Common core code for event I/O is in `io`, and shared utilities
in `util`.

### Processors

The fundamental piece of analysis code is a `Processor`, which operates on
gallery events and writes an output tree. A processor can add additional
branches to the tree, or save any other desired objects to the output
file. Configuration parameters may be passed to a processor using a
JSON file.

One runs a processor by calling a framework-wide binary, like this:

    sbn -m MyAnalysis_MySelection -c CONFIG.json INPUT1.root INPUT2.root

Multiple processors can be run at the same time, and configurations are
optional. For example:

    sbn -m PROC1 -c CONFIG1 -m PROC2 -m PROC3 -c CONFIG3 INPUT.root

Note that the order matters: the configuration applies to the processor
it follows.

Documentation
-------------
The code is fully documented with Doxygen. To build it, run

    doxygen doc/Doxyfile

The output HTML documentation is placed in `doc/html/index.html`.

*Note to developers:* All code in `sbnanalysis` should be completely
documented with Doxygen-compatible comments. Please build the
documentation before committing to check for anything missing.

Building
--------
The build process is managed by [CMake](https://cmake.org). A number of
dependencies are required to read art ROOT files, which are most easily
configured using [ups](https://cdcvs.fnal.gov/redmine/projects/ups/wiki).

A shell script which installs sbncode (and sbnanalysis) in a new mrb
working area is provided in `env`.

To set things up manually, start by configuring an environment for reading
SBND or MicroBooNE files on a host with CVMFS access:
    
    source /cvmfs/sbnd.opensciencegrid.org/products/sbnd/setup_sbnd.sh
    source /cvmfs/uboone.opensciencegrid.org/products/setup_uboone.sh
    source /cvmfs/icarus.opensciencegrid.org/products/icarus/setup_icarus.sh

Then setup your favorite, non-conflicting, <sbnd/icarus/uboone>code releases.
Then set up the appropriate versions of gallery, cmake, and jsoncpp, e.g.:
    
    setup gallery v1_06_04 -q e14:prof:nu
    setup cmake v3_9_0
    setup jsoncpp v1_7_7a -q e14:prof

Note: In the future an `sbncode` UPS product will automatically set up
the dependencies to read files for any SBN experiment.

To build the software:

    mkdir build && cd build  # A directory for build products
    cmake ..  # Configure the build system
    make install  # Build
    source bin/setup_sbnanalysis.sh  # Set up environment

Note that the setup script `setup_sbnanalysis.sh` is created during the
build and contains absolute paths to the installation location.

The `cmake` command accepts many useful options. For example:

* `-DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/some/path`: Install the software at  `/some/path`.
  The default is to install inside the build directory.
* `-DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug`: Build with debugging flags enabled (i.e. `-g`)

In addition, it is possible to configure `cmake` to compile one of your
processors into a standalone executable which can be easy to run on,
e.g., the grid. To do this, run

    cmake -DSBNANA_COMPILED_PROCESSOR=YOUR_PROCESSOR_NAME

Then, every time you build the software, your processor will get built as
a standalone executable. To unset building a standalone executable, run

    cmake -USBNANA_COMPILED_PROCESSOR

Final binaries are placed in the `bin` directory and libraries in `lib`.

Tutorial
--------
A primary goal of this package is to centralize development of event selection
code and fitting frameworks, and establish a standard analysis tree format
that is compatible with all fitters. As such, the fundamental object in
`sbnanalysis` is an event processor class which writes a standard ROOT tree,
plus additional user-specified data.

### A Selection Analysis ###
Analysis code is stored in subdirectories of `ana`, one per analysis. These
directories contain any utility code and algorithms, and a selection class
which is a subclass of `core::SelectionBase`. Note that all code should
should be defined inside a namespace `ana::NameOfAnalysis`.

The selection code must define the following methods:

* `void Initialize(Json::Value* config)`: Load configuration parameters and
  perform analysis-specific setup, such as defining histograms, and adding
  custom branches to the output tree.

* `void Finalize()`: Perform analysis-specific tear-down, such as computing
  statistics and writing histograms to the output file.

* `bool ProcessEvent(gallery::Event& ev)`: Perform the event-level analysis,
  such as filling histograms and setting the variables corresponding to the
  custom branches (they will filled -- written to the tree --  automatically).
  The return value is used for event filtering: if `ProcessEvent` returns
  false, the event is not written to the output tree.

The user is free to add arbitrary branches to the default output ROOT tree,
using the method `void AddBranch(std::string name, T* object)` where the first
argument is the branch name and the second is a refernce to the object, which
shold be a member variable of the user's selection class.

Note that `Initialize` (`Finalize`) is called after the after (before) the base
selection class setup and teardown, so you have access to the ROOT output file
and the output tree in these methods.

As an example, a selection subclass might look like this:

```c++
namespace ana {
  namespace ExampleAnalysis {

class ExampleSelection : public core::SelectionBase {
public:
  ExampleSelection();
  void Initialize();
  void Finalize();
  bool ProcessEvent(const gallery::Event& ev,
                    const std::vector<Event::Interaction> &truth,
                    std::vector<Event::RecoInteraction>& reco);

protected:
  int fMyVar;  // For a custom branch
};
```

with an implementation like:

```c++
#include <iostream>
#include "gallery/ValidHandle.h"
#include "ExampleSelection.h"

namespace ana {
  namespace ExampleAnalysis {
    // Constructor
    ExampleSelection::ExampleSelection() : SelectionBase() {}

    // Setup
    void ExampleSelection::Initialize() {
      AddBranch("myvar", &fMyVar);  // Define a custom branch
    }

    // Teardown
    void ExampleSelection::Finalize() {}

    // Event processing
    bool ExampleSelection::ProcessEvent(
        const gallery::Event& ev,
        const std::vector<Event::Interaction>& truth,
        std::vector<Event::RecoInteraction>& reco) {
      // ... Process the gallery::Event ...
      fMyVar = 42;  // Fill in the custom branch
      return true;
    }
  }  // namespace ExampleAnalysis
}  // namespace ana

// Important!: Declare the selection to sbnanalysis.
DECLARE_SBN_PROCESSOR(ana::ExampleAnalysis::ExampleSelection)
```

Note that the final `DECLARE_SBN_PROCESSOR` line is required to run the code
within the sbnanalysis framework.

Finally, new source code must be added to the library definitions in the
`CMakeLists.txt` file within the analysis subdirectory. See the provided
`ExampleAnalysis` for an example.

### Running the Analysis

The analysis code is run over a set of files using a framework-level
executable:

    sbn -m PROCESSOR [-c CONFIG] [-m PROCESSOR [-c CONFIG] ...] INPUT

    PROCESSOR - Name of processor, typically AnalysisName_SelectionName
    CONFIG - JSON configuration file
    INPUT - Input files (see note)

The configuration file contains settings which are passed to the selection
processor's `Initialize` function.

The input files can be defined as one or more ROOT files (ending in .root).
Support is planned for file lists and SAM dataset definitions in future
versions.

To run the above example (after building):

    sbn -m ExampleAnalysis_ExampleSelection -c ExampleConfig.json input.root

Or, if you have configured `cmake` to build `ExampleAnalysis_ExampleSelection`
as a standalone executable:

    SBNProcessor_ExampleAnalysis_ExampleSelection \
        -c config1.json -c config2.json input.root

### Analyzing the Output

The output file is a ROOT file with a tree named `sbnana` plus any additional
objects written by the selection code. The `sbnana` tree contains a branch
called `events`; this is the standard event-level information written out
by all processors, stored in an `Event` object. See `core/Event.hh` for the
complete definition.

To read the output files in ROOT, one must load the event dictionary, which
is stored in `libsbnanalysis_Processor.so`. Compiled code should link to this
library, and on the ROOT command line one can run:

    .L lib/libsbnanalysis_Event.so

Now, we can open the file in a `TBrowser`:

![Screenshot of the ROOT browser](doc/output_root.png)

One can make plots interactively, or analyze this tree with a ROOT macro or
script. For example, in the ROOT console:

    root [0] .L lib/libsbnanalysis_Event.so
    root [1] TFile f("output.root")
    root [2] sbnana->Draw("interactions.lepton.energy")

This will produce a plot of the primary lepton energies for all neutrino
interactions:
